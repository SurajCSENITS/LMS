# Learning Management System (LMS) Client

Welcome to the LMS Client project! This project is built using React and Vite, providing a fast and modern development experience.

## Getting Started

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and some ESLint rules.

### Available Plugins

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh.
